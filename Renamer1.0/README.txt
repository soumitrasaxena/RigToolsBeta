Renamer 1.0
------------------------

The inbuilt Maya 'prefix' and 'search and replace names' features are useful , but not enough to meet our requirements , especially when it comes to rigging and exporting.

This simple script allows you to conveniently add 'prefix' and 'suffix' to the entire tree hierarchy of nodes , instead of manually selecting each and every one of them.

This is useful especially during rigging complex models , when you want to properly organise a lot of joints and handles.

How It Works :
---------------------

1. Add the prefix that you want. (if any)
2. Add the suffix that you want. (if any)
3. Select the head node of the chain.
4. Select the chain option.
5. Click on Rename !
